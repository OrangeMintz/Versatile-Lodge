Versatile Lodge is an online booking reservation system built with React (Vite) on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend, designed to streamline hotel room bookings and reservation management. The system supports both user and admin interfaces, enabling customers to browse rooms, register accounts, make bookings, submit reviews, and manage their profiles.

## Note
On the administrative side, roles are divided into Admin and Cashier, where Admins manage employee accounts and overall system settings, while Cashiers handle booking approvals and walk-in reservations
